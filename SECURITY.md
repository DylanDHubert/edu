# HHB Assistant - Security

**Date:** August 2025 
**Version:** 1.0

## Summary

The HHB Assistant codebase implements authentication, authorization, and database security measures.

## Security Assessment

| Category | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Authentication | Supabase Auth with session management |
| Authorization | Role-based access control |
| Data Protection | Row-level security and parameterized queries |
| Input Validation | Sanitization and type checking |
| File Security | Type validation and size limits |
| Infrastructure | Security headers and rate limiting |

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- Supabase Auth integration with proper session management
- Role-based access control (manager/member roles)
- Admin controls with email-based verification
- Comprehensive route protection middleware
- Proper service client architecture

### Database Security
- SQL injection protection via parameterized queries
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Safe query methods using Supabase
- Proper database indexing

### File Upload Security
- PDF file type validation only
- 512MB file size limit
- Manager-only upload permissions
- Unique filenames prevent path traversal
- Secure upload mechanism via Supabase

### Input Validation
- String input sanitization
- Required field validation
- Data type checking

## Implemented Security Features

### Security Headers
- X-Frame-Options: DENY (clickjacking protection)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (MIME sniffing protection)
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Permissions-Policy (restricts camera, microphone, geolocation)
- Strict-Transport-Security (HTTPS enforcement)

### Input Sanitization
- DOMPurify integration for XSS prevention
- Server-side HTML sanitization
- Applied to chat messages and user content

### File Content Validation
- Real file content analysis using file-type library
- Validates PDF files against actual content
- Prevents malicious files with spoofed MIME types

### Rate Limiting
- File upload: 10 requests per hour
- Chat: 10 requests per minute
- General API: 100 requests per 15 minutes

### Environment Validation
- Startup validation for required environment variables
- Prevents runtime errors from missing configuration

## Security Best Practices

- Authentication with Supabase Auth
- Role-based access control
- Row-level security on database
- Parameterized database queries
- File upload restrictions with content validation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper error handling
- Security headers
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Environment variable validation
- CORS configuration

## Future Enhancements

- Structured logging for security events
- Multi-factor authentication
- Data encryption at rest
- Virus scanning for uploads
- Security monitoring and alerting

## Incident Response

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Determine scope of breach
   - Identify root cause
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Restore systems
   - Monitor for continued threats

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct lessons learned
   - Update security measures
   - Improve procedures
